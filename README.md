This is a simple and straight-forward (mostly) configuration system based on a blacklist idea.

The genesis of this is Minecraft Modding - specifically the "Metals" series of mods from the
MinecraftModDevelopment people. (disclaimer: I am the lead programmer (but not project lead)
of most of the "Metals" mods) Simply put... Those mods can add a horrendously large amount
of blocks and items and as they are meant as a helper for mod-pack makers, configuring the
various different blocks, items and materials to be "on" or "off" is a time consuming
proposition if it needs to be in the whitelist-like format of the classic MinecraftForge
config files. Hence this - a blacklist based format that is similar to, but not entirely
unlike, JSON.

Enjoy!
